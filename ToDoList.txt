### To-Do List in Priority Order

1. **Script to receive input time for the countdown**
2. **Validate input**
3. **Display a countdown timer**
4. **Emphasize the end of the countdown**
5. **Logging and error handling**
6. **Prepare for web migration**
7. **Develop additional features**

### Next Steps

1. **Develop the Python script further**:
    - Implement logging and error handling.
    - Add unit tests for input validation and countdown functionality.
    - Ensure countdown persistence across sessions (using IP).

2. **Create a lightweight web page**:
    - Set up a simple web server (using Flask or Django).
    - Allow users to input a deadline and view the countdown.
    - Implement IP-based session persistence.
    - Add the Dolomiti image as a background.
    - Add a shareable link feature to invite friends.
